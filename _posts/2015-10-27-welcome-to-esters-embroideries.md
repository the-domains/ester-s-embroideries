Hello! Welcome to Mistress Ester Pickering's site on embroidery and other cool historical crafts.  As a kid & teen I did cross stitch and then moved on to 16th Century Elizabethan Embroidery after I joined [Gardiners Company][0]. Several of my friends worked on the [Plimouth Jacket Project][1] and this rekindled my interest in embroidery. While I was not able to work on the jacket project myself, I learned the stitches they used and took a Gold Work Master Class from [Thistle Threads][2]. I then went on to design my own Elizabethan style sweet bag that took several years to complete. I continue to work on new projects and have recently completed a stumpwork class. ![Elizabethan style sweet bag](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c50b2c34-31c1-45b8-b623-92b8f62de07a.jpg)

I have a variety of documentation on my sweet bag as well as my embroidered shirts. Feel free to share whatever you'd like, I just request you credit where you got the information from. Enjoy and feel free to drop me a line with any questions or comments!
